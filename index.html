        <span>Now that we've looked at the architecture
        of the internet, let's see how you might</span>
        <span>connect your personal devices to
        the internet inside your house.</span>
        <span>Well there are many ways to
        connect to the internet, and</span>
        <span>most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="active">Let's look at an example of how
        you can connect to the internet.</span>
        <span>If you live in a city or a town,
        you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>
        <span>cable Internet, or a phone line if you
        have DSL, running to the outside of</span>
        <span>your house, that connects you to
        the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span>
        <span>If you live far out in the country,
        you'll more likely have</span>
        <span>a dish outside your house, connecting
        you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span>
        <span>you might also use the telephone system.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Whether a wire comes straight from
        the ISP hookup outside your house, or</span>
        <span>it travels over radio
        waves from your roof,</span>
        <span>the first stop a wire will make once
        inside your house, is at your modem.</span>
        <span>A modem is what connects the internet
        to your network at home.</span>
        <span>A few common residential modems are DSL or</span>
