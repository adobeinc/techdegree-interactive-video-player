# TechDegree Project 6: Interactive Video Player

This project showcases use of the **HTML5 Video API** and **JavaScript**. 

The video player synchronizes the video with the transcript in two ways: 

1. The transcript's current position is highlighted as the video progresses. 

2. When users click any part of the transcript, they will be taken to the appropriate place in the video.
